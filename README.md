# AQUMUN
This is a website for Al-Quds Medical Center students to announce any conferences that they plan on making.
Other medical students from other Palestinian universities can go on the website and register by adding their email and name.
Every email gets one entry to prevent spamming.
They can either pay via credit card or cash to receive a ticket to enter the conference.
